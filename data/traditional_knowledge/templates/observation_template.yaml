  additional_notes:
    stories: |
      "One time a cow was dying and the young farmers wanted to call the vet immediately.
      I smelled the urine and told them to wait and watch. The cow went straight to 
      the aloe plants and ate them for two days. The cow recovered completely. 
      The animals know their medicine - we just need to watch and learn."

    teaching_tips: "Teach young people to use ALL their senses. Books can't teach you smell."
